To find you,
Afraid I bother you;
Don't find you,
Afraid you forgot me.
(找你怕你烦我, 不找你怕你忘记我)

My story,
Will you,
As a joke,
Talk to him.
(我的故事,你会不会当做笑话讲给他听)


I replied to her,
A second;
She replied to me,
A lifetime.
(我回你是秒回, 你回我是轮回)


I almost lost my ability to control myself,
But she,
So calm;
She didn't love me,
But she,
Can be very easy to stimulate me.
(我几乎快失去控制自己的能力了, 可你不爱我, 却很冷静的轻而易举的刺激到我)


I,
A hard working passers-by,
Desperate but Hope for hope,
Think that has enough effort,
I can become the protagonist.
(像是卖力演出的路人甲, 绝望又心怀侥幸地以为只要足够努力就能升格为主角)


She,
Let you have a hope,
In the tomorrow,
However,
She,
Didn't appear at all,
In your tomorrow.
(她曾让你对明天有所期许, 但她却完全没有出现在你的明天里)


I,
Like at a airport,
In the rain,
Waiting for a train.
(就像在飞机场, 等一列火车)


In front of you,
I am at a loss;
In front of me,
You are irrelevant.
(你是我的不知所措，我是你的无关痛痒)


Silently start,
Silently ended,
From start to end,
She didn't know.
(自己默默地开始,自己默默地结束;从头到尾,他都不知道)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously,
Never owned,
However,
Be swayed by,
Considerations of gain and loss.
(明明从未拥有却又患得患失)


Always feel,
Finish the next thing,
She,
Will love me.
(总觉得做完下一件事情她就会喜欢上你)


Obviously,
Known,
She doesn't,
love me,
Still,
Ask myself,
Many times,
Does she love me?
(就算知道她不喜欢自己 也会问自己很多遍她喜不喜欢我)


Don't love you,
How nice it will be.
(如果我不喜欢你多好)


All her,
Unintentional behaviors,
All my,
Imagining things.
(所有他的无心之举，都会被我胡思乱想)


Love is the child, 
Of illusion,
And the parent,
Of disillusion.
(始于幻觉，终于醒悟)


If,
More effort,
More persist,
Perhaps,
She will love me.
(如果再努力一点点，坚持久一点点，或者她会喜欢上我呢)


The person I love,
Love me,
Originally,
Is a miracle.
(我喜欢的人也喜欢我, 本身就是个奇迹)
